# Discrete-Binary-PSO
The particle swarm algorithm classically operates in a continuous
space through adjusting a population of “particles” within the objective space by using information about each particle’s previous best
performance, and the best performance from the whole population.
Trajectories were defined as changes in position for a number of
dimensions. The binary particle swarm redefines this in order to
work in a discrete objective space by considering trajectories as
changes in the probability that a coordinate will take a discrete
value. The efficacy of this approach is empirically analysed using
the De Jong testbed.
